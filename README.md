# Git-beginners-guide

## Introduction

## What is Git?
Git is a version control platform.  The main benefit of using Git is to track changes to a repository.

The changes that are tracked include the following:
* What changes were made
* When they were made
* Who made the changes

There are many different interfaces of Git.
A few interfaces that come to mind are:
* GitHub
* GitLab
* Gitea
* Command-Line

This guide will only focus on 2 interfaces:
* GitHub
* Command-Line

## What You'll Need

### Basic Command-Line Knowledge

**For Mac Users:**

Click the magnifying glass in the top-right of your screen and type ```terminal```.

Click on ```Terminal.app```.

This will bring up your terminal.

**For Windows Users \(like me\):**

While you *can* use your ```cmd``` or ```Powershell``` applications, you should avoid using them like the plague.
This is because some commands differ between Windows and Mac.  Mac OS behaves more like Linux, a separate operationg system from Windows and Mac.

Believe me when I say, you want a more Linux-like experience.
In order to get that, there are several options to choose from.
I will only recommned 2 to keep it simple.
* [git for windows/Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) **Pick this one!**
  * Will be used in this guide.
  * Easier to install/set up.
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) 
  * More complex.
  * Many things to configure when installing.

In order to be efficient with Git, you need to get used to using the command line.

Basic commands not exclusive to Git include the following:
* ```pwd```
  * This is the "print work directory" command.  It tells you where you are in your file system.
* ```ls```
  * This is the "list" command.
  * It lists all the files and directories in your current directory.
* ```cd```
  * This is the "change directory" command.  A directory is the same thing as a folder.
  * You'll use it whenever you want to go to a certian directory.
  * **Special note 1: Use Tab!** For example, typing ```cd Docu``` and then pressing your ```Tab``` key will autocomplete the word "Documents".
  * **Special note 2: Whatever you try to autocomplete with tab must already exist!  The directory you're trying to change to must also already exist.**
* ```mkdir```
  * This is the "make directory" command.  It makes a new directory in your current directory.
  
 There are a few more, like ```cp``` \(copy\), ```mv``` \(move\) and ```rm``` \(remove\), but you should wait to learn those untill you've gotten used to the previous 4 commands.
 
 ### Example of Basic Commands
 I'll walk you through an example of the commands mentioned above.
 
 Let's start by opening Git Bash.
