# Git-beginners-guide

## Introduction

## What is Git?
Git is a version control platform.  The main benefit of using Git is to track changes to a repository.

The changes that are tracked include the following:
* What changes were made
* When they were made
* Who made the changes

There are many different interfaces of Git.
A few interfaces that come to mind are:
* GitHub
* GitLab
* Gitea
* Command-Line

This guide will only focus on 2 interfaces:
* GitHub
* Command-Line

## What You'll Need

### Basic Command-Line Knowledge

**For Mac Users:**

Click the magnifying glass in the top-right of your screen and type ```terminal```.

Click on ```Terminal.app```.

This will bring up your terminal.

**For Windows Users \(like me\):**

While you *can* use your ```cmd``` or ```Powershell``` applications, you should avoid using them like the plague.
This is because some commands differ between Windows and Mac.  Mac OS behaves more like Linux, a separate operationg system from Windows and Mac.

Believe me when I say, you want a more Linux-like experience.
In order to get that, there are several options to choose from.
I will only recommned 2 to keep it simple.
* [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) **Easier to install/set up**
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) **More complex; many things to configure when installing**

In order to be efficient with Git, you need to get used to using the command line.

Basic commands not exclusive to Git include the following:
* ```cd```
  * This is the "change directory" command.  A directory is the same thing as a folder.
  * You'll use it whenever you want to go to a certian folder.
